# You are the beginning of a password series. Every mission will be based on the previous one. Going forward the missions will become slightly more complex.
#
# In this mission you need to create a password verification function.
#
# Those are the verification conditions:
#
# the length should be bigger than 6.
# Input: A string.
#
# Output: A bool.
#
# Example:
#
# is_acceptable_password('short') == False
# is_acceptable_password('muchlonger') == True
